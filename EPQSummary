## Introduction

## Why I chose the project

## What I learned

Througout the project I learned about CAD Software, used a game engine in new ways, learned about raspberry pi and electronics while getting a deeper understanding of computers and the internet.

## OpenSCAD

Initially I was looking into various cad software. After trying to learn FreeCAD for a week making slow progress I decided to try OpenSCAD which is a CAD software for programmers. 
This lead me to learn more about the command line as I had to install it through homebrew.
## Electronics

## Godot Simulation

## Problems I had on the way

## What I would do if I had more time or had to redo it

If I had to do the project again or while continuing it there would be quite a few things I would do differently. 
However I found that with a project like this whenever you try something different it would open for even more ideas and improvements that I want to do. This made it is impossible to perfect and mark it as finished.
I would have made more visual drawings or physical models of the project and plan before spending time making modular models in the CAD software.
